### ‚úÖ Honcker ![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/DesktopGooseUnofficial/ResourceHub/honcker/total?label=downloads&logo=github&style=plastic)
* A very simple mod that allows you to make your goose honk at will with the F key.

### ‚úÖ Goose Jail ![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/WackyModer/GooseJail/total?logo=github)
* Allows you to trap the goose in a cage.
* You may also free the goose and choose its (the jail's) position.

### ‚úÖ BreadCrumbs ![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/euandeas/GooseMod_BreadCrumbs/total?logo=github)
* This mod allows you to feed the goose to make him walk across your screen, or to calm him down when he is in a frenzy.
* Plus he makes cute nom sounds.
* **Usage:** Press 'Right Shift Button' to throw crumbs at your mouse pointer. This can be changed in the Config, but remember to read the `README.md` for the mod.

### ‚úÖ DragGoose ![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/euandeas/GooseMod_DragGoose/total?logo=github)
* This is a simple mod which allows you to drag the goose around your screen.
* But be careful: he may try to bite and the grab may be unsuccessful.
* If you do manage to catch him, the goose will panic, and if you drag too fast, he may get free.
* **P.S.:** Be careful when dragging the goose; you will still highlight/select stuff in the background.

### ‚úÖ Toys ![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/TheOrlando/DesktopGooseMod_Toys/total?logo=github)
* **Menu:** Tab menu in the lower-left corner of the display for toggling toys.

* **Ball:** A ball to bounce around and play with (same as BallMod).
* **Stick:** Throw a stick for the Goose to fetch and return to you.
* **Bed:** Send the Goose to take a nap, useful if you want the Goose to leave you alone.
